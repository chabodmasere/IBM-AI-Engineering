# IBM AI Engineering — LaTeX Notes

This repository contains my personal LaTeX notes from the IBM AI Engineering course. It serves as a structured technical log covering machine learning fundamentals, deep learning, model evaluation, and applied workflows.

The project is synced directly from Overleaf to GitHub, so updates reflect ongoing study, experimentation, and refinement. Notes are written for clarity, engineering rigor, and future reference.
